# 🛡️ C# Essential - Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal journey and progress while learning C# through the course **"C# Essencial (.NET 10.0, LINQ e IA)" by Professor Jose Carlos Macoratti**.

It serves as a collection of my exercises developed throughout the course to master the C# language and the .NET ecosystem.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

The main goals of this repository are:

* **Document Progress:** To track my learning curve and the application of C# concepts, from basic syntax to advanced topics like LINQ and AI integration.
* **Implementations:** To store clean and functional versions of the exercises proposed by the instructor.
* **Reference:** To serve as a personal knowledge base for .NET 10.0 patterns, C# syntax, and best practices.

P.S.: Not every single exercise from the course will be present; I focus on those that are most relevant, challenging, or represent a significant milestone in my learning.
